# Hart.ly

Hartly is a project to help find remote/hybrid work and help build resumes.

### How it Works

The App uses third party job scraping service like [Serply](https://serply.io/) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/api/) to generate the resumes and cover letter. Both are free service for limited use.

## Getting Started

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

### API Keys

You'll need to specify Serply and OpenAI API keys in the `.env.local` file

```bash
SERPLY_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```


## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheHartly/jobs.git
cd jobs
npm install
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
